ShadowBans

A project by the ShadowCasted team:

- This banning plugin will take advantage of the 1.7.9 UUID.
Features:
- Banning
- Unbanning
- Kicking
- Temporary banning
- Writing the user's UUID to the config (not just their username)
- Able to check bans with an in game command
- IP banning of the player
- Broadcasted or silent ban, whether only the person banning can only see the message or everyone on the server can
(Maybe even give a way so that a few people could see the message with a certain permission)
Config options:
- Ban broadcasted, whehter the ban is allowed to be broadcasted or not, (if this is false, all bans will be silent)
- Write to Bukkit, will backup the bans from this plugin with the bukkit's banned-players.yml
- When a player joins, the config writes the user's name into the config, with options under the name such as "banned" which 
will be false by default. 
- IP Address of player
- More to come
